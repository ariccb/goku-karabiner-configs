## setup
once you've installed karabiner-elements and goku, place either my `karabiner.edn` file (if you use ColemakDH instead of Qwerty for your keyboard layout) - or `simple-for-sharing-karabiner.edn`
file in your ~/.config folder on your mac.

If you choose to use to use the `simple-for-sharing-karabiner.edn` file, you will need to rename it to "karabiner.edn" for it to work. 

If you want to learn how to customize your layout to suit your own needs, refer to the links and documentation that [GokuRakuJoudo has in his repo on GitHub](https://github.com/yqrashawn/GokuRakuJoudo)
